   Overall structure of the core modules.

This package (`repository link <https://github.com/TOB-KNPOB/Ultra-Motion-Capture>`_) is developed for the data processing of the 3dMD 4D scanning system. Comparing with traditional motion capture system, such as Vicon:

- Vicon motion capture system can provided robust & accurate key points tracking based on physical marker points attached to human body. But it suffer from the lack of continuous surface deformation information.

- 3dMD 4D scanning system can record continuous surface deformation information. But it doesn't provide key point tracking feature and it's challenging to track the key points via Computer Vision approach, even with the state of the art methods in academia [#]_.

To facilitate human factor research, we deem it an important task to construct a hybrid system that can integrate the advantages and potentials of both systems. The motivation and the core value of this project can be described as: *adding continuous spatial dynamic information to Vicon* or *adding discrete key points information to 3dMD*, leading to advancing platform for human factor research in the domain of dynamic human activity.
